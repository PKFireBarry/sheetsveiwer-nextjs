# Google Sheet Job Card Viewer - User Guide

## Overview  
This application allows you to view and interact with data from a Google Sheet in a structured, easy-to-read job card format. Instead of manually navigating large spreadsheets, you can enter a sheet URL and browse the data row by row.

## How It Works  

1. **Enter the Google Sheet URL**  
   - Copy the link to the Google Sheet you want to view.  
   - Paste the URL into the input box at the top of the application.  

2. **Load the Data**  
   - Press **Enter** or click the submit button.  
   - The application will process the sheet and display its contents as job cards.  

3. **View Job Cards**  
   - Each row of the spreadsheet is shown as a separate job card.  
   - Cards will display all relevant details from the sheet in a structured format.  

## Requirements  
- The Google Sheet.  
 

## Troubleshooting
